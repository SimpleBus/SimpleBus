DoctrineORMBridge
=================

This package provides command bus middlewares that can be used to
integrate
`SimpleBus/MessageBus <https://github.com/SimpleBus/MessageBus>`__ with
`Doctrine ORM <https://github.com/doctrine/doctrine2>`__.

It provides an easy way to `wrap command handling in a database
transaction <../Components/DoctrineORMBridge.html#transactions>`__
and `handle domain events generated by
entities <../Components/DoctrineORMBridge.html#domain-events>`__.

@TODO The intro should explain what it does.

Getting started
---------------

Installation
............

Using `Composer <https://getcomposer.org/>`__:

.. code-block::  bash

    composer require simple-bus/doctrine-orm-bridge

Preparations
............

To use the middlewares provided by the library, `set up a command
bus <../Guides/command_bus.html>`__ and
an `event
bus <../Guides/event_bus.html>`__, if
you didn't already do this:

.. code-block::  php

    use SimpleBus\Message\Bus\Middleware\MessageBusSupportingMiddleware;

    $commandBus = new MessageBusSupportingMiddleware();
    ...

    $eventBus = new MessageBusSupportingMiddleware();
    ...

Make sure to also properly set up an entity manager:

.. code-block::  php

    // $entityManager is an instance of Doctrine\ORM\EntityManager
    $entityManager = ...;

Now add the available middlewares for `transaction
handling <transactions.md>`__ and `domain events <domain_events.md>`__.


Transactions
------------

It is generally a good idea to wrap command handling in a database
transaction. If you want to do this, add the
``WrapsMessageHandlingInTransaction`` middleware to the command bus.
Provide an instance of the Doctrine ``ManagerRegistry`` interface and
the name of the entity manager that you want to use.

.. code-block::  php

    use SimpleBus\DoctrineORMBridge\MessageBus\WrapsMessageHandlingInTransaction;

    /*
     * $managerRegistry is an instance of Doctrine\Common\Persistence\ManagerRegistry
     *
     * For example: if you use Symfony, use the "doctrine" service
     */
    $managerRegistry = ...;

    $transactionalMiddleware = new WrapsMessageHandlingInTransaction($managerRegistry, 'default');

    $commandBus->addMiddleware($transactionalMiddleware);

.. note:: Once you have added this middleware, you shouldn't call
    ``EntityManager::flush()`` manually from inside your command
    handlers anymore.

Domain events
-------------

Using the `message recorder
facilities <../Guides/message_recorder.html>`__
from ``SimpleBus/MessageBus`` you can let Doctrine ORM collect domain
events and subsequently let the event bus handle them.

Make sure that your entities implement the ``ContainsRecordedMessages``
interface. Use the ``PrivateMessageRecorderCapabilities`` trait to
conveniently record events from inside the entity:

.. code-block::  php

    use SimpleBus\Message\Recorder\ContainsRecordedMessages;
    use SimpleBus\Message\Recorder\PrivateMessageRecorderCapabilities;

    class YourEntity implements ContainsRecordedMessages
    {
        use PrivateMessageRecorderCapabilities;

        public function changeSomething()
        {
            // record new events like this:

            $this->record(new SomethingChanged());
        }
    }

Then set up the *event recorder* for Doctrine entities:

.. code-block::  php

    use SimpleBus\DoctrineORMBridge\EventListener\CollectsEventsFromEntities;

    $eventRecorder = new CollectsEventsFromEntities();

    $entityManager->getConnection()->getEventManager()->addEventSubscriber($eventRecorder);

The event recorder will loop over all the entities that were involved in
the last database transaction and collect their internally recorded
events.

After a database transaction was completed successfully these events
should be handled by the event bus. This is done by a specialized
middleware, which should be appended to the command bus *before* the
middleware that is responsible for handling the transaction.

.. code-block::  php

    use SimpleBus\DoctrineORMBridge\MessageBus\WrapsMessageHandlingInTransaction;

    use SimpleBus\Message\Bus\MessageBus;

    $eventDispatchingMiddleware = new HandlesRecordedMessagesMiddleware($eventProvider, $eventBus);
    // N.B. append this middleware *before* the WrapsMessageHandlingInTransaction middleware
    $commandBus->appendMiddleware($eventDispatchingMiddleware);

    $transactionalMiddleware = new WrapsMessageHandlingInTransaction($entityManager);
    $commandBus->appendMiddleware($transactionalMiddleware);

.. note:: The ``MessageBusSupportingMiddleware`` class also has a
    ``prependMiddleware()`` method, which you can use to prepend
    middleware instead of appending it.
